# Devour The Burger

## Description

This is a burger logger app that let's the user input burger names that they would like to eat or have already eaten. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the upper side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button with a cutlery icon. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the lower card on the page.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not. 

The app was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!) while following the MVC design. Node and MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
